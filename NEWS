The 9.x series of Reap is a beta version leading upto
a stable 10.0 release.

The system is starting to work well. There are still some
rough edges to iron and polish, but on the whole it is
looking good. In fact this release marks a high-usability
point with the system. And with the next release or two
it should be just about ready for general consumption.

Two last major considerations are left: the orginizaiton of
the metadata; and many binaries vs. one binary. While I
like the many binaries idea, borrowed from git. The one
binary design is more flexible for supporting per-project plugins.

An important previous change, that I will reiterate in these
notes: doc/, pkg/ and log/ directories are now fixed standard
conventions.s
