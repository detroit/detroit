= Task List

== PRIORITY

* When generating docs from a subdirectory, it doesn not appear to be moving up to
the root directory before executing tasks. Check ridoc in particular.

* Use flag for isolating syckle files. Also provide -o --only option to complement -s --skip.

* Parallel execution needs alternate io class so that output can look okay no matter what order
it is in.


== CONSDIER

* Use CLIO?

* Should minimize use of environament variables. This makes for a more repeatable build process.


== COMPLETED

* Parallel Execution. Within a phase, any service instances that have the same priority can be run
in parallel. I do not know how this would effect output, but it would be nice to have
since some services can take some time to complete, such as rcov.
