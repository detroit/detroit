= TODO List

== Parallel Execution [DONE]

* Within a phase, any service instances that have the same priority can be run
in parallel. I do not know how this would effect output, but it would be nice to have
since some services can take some time to complete, such as rcov.

== Current Considerations

* When generating docs from a subdirectory, it doesn not appear to be moving up to
the root directory before executing tasks. Check ridoc in particular.

== Action Output

* Use CLIO and FOLIO!

== Action Specifications

* An omit_actions option for service definitions might be nice,
in order to specify a specific set of action not to include.

== Platform Builds

* platform builds (part of BOX).

== Root Indicator

* What are we using for this? The Roor indicatoer should become meta/ruby.

== Environment

* Should minimize use of environament variables.
* This makes for a more repeatable build process.
