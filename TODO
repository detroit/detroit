= Task List

* When generating docs from a subdirectory, it doesn not appear to be moving up to
the root directory before executing tasks. Check ridoc in particular.

* Use CLIO?

* platform builds (part of BOX).

* Should minimize use of environament variables. This makes for a more repeatable build process.

* [DONE] Parallel Execution. Within a phase, any service instances that have the same priority can be run
in parallel. I do not know how this would effect output, but it would be nice to have
since some services can take some time to complete, such as rcov.
