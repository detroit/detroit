= Reap

* http://reap.rubyforge.org

== DESCRIPTION

Reap is a Ruby-oriented build tool. Reap provides a systematic
methodology to help developers prepare and release Ruby projects.


== SYNOPSIS

Using Reap is not diffcult, but it does take a few minutes to learn
how it operates. 

In short, Reap defines a pipeline within which all Reap tasks run.
You define tasks as YAML configuration files in you projects +task+
directory with a .reap extension, eg. +box.reap+.

Tasks often draw on metadata about your project. This is defined using
POM (See http://proutils.rubyforge.org/pom). Essentially you add
files to your project's +meta+ directory to do this (or meta.yaml
file if you'd rather).

With task configuration and metadata in place, using reap is simply
a matter of invoking the pipeline and phase you wish to complete.

  $ reap document

The +main+ pipeline is used by default, so the above command tiggers
every phase in the +main+ pipeline until it complete the +document+
phase.

The use of a pipeline may seem constrictive, but it insures your project
to always be uptodate and insync.

Please see http://proutils.rubyforge.org/reap for more details on how to
use Reap. Also try the +--help+ option to see the reap command's
help information.


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see the NEWS file.


== INSTALLATION

Reap can, of course, be installed via RubyGems:

  $ sudo gem install reap

Reap can also be installed the old-fashion way by downloading the .tar.gz
package and using Ruby Setup (See http://setup.rubyforge.org).

  $ tar -xvzf reap-10.0.0.tar.gz
  $ cd reap-10.0.0
  $ sudo setup.rb all

Ruby Setup is stand-alone version of the original setup.rb script.
