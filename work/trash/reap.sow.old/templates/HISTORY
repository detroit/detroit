== 0.0.0 // 2008-03-04

* Started project.


# Keep a running list of changes by version and date here.
# This is uploaded as the ChangeLog in the release process.
# It's better to keep a manual log, rather then use the log
# generated by the SCM because the SCM log will have gritty
# details with which end-users will not be concerned.
#
# If you want to use the SCM log anyway, you can of course
# do so. Just "cp log/Changelog.txt CHANGES" prior to release.
# (We might provide an automated option for this in the
# future, but for now its a manual task.)
