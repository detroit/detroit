# Rename Redux

**(2011-06-11)**

Twelve days later and I'm still struggling to name this project.
There are things I like and dislike about all the names I tried
thus far. I was very close to selecting `Pitstop`, but my gut
feeling tells me that it overly connotes the concept of "repair",
and thus would be more suited to a debugging tool.

Trying to find a new name, but staying with the theme of race tracks,
I thought about `OnTrack` and also `Finishline` harking back to previous
`Redline`.

I later realized that a more fitting analogy for the program
is a production or assembly line. Keeping with the "red" theme
I could name it `RedAssembly` or `RedStation`, or `Redford` named
after Henry Ford. I even considerd `Rosie` after Rosie the Riveter.

As I went to write this note, I entitled it `Rename Redux`, 
and `Redux` struck me a potential name too, since it is cyclic
in nature.

Postmodern has helped me reduce the decision to these.

* Pitstop
* Detroit
* Senro

Senro means road or track in Japanese.
