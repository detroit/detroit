# Two Projects or Just One?

Looks like I will forgo splitting the runner off and renaming it as
a separate project. After careful consideration I am not sure there
is enough to Detroit to justify a set of reusable tools without the
concept of the toolchain runner to go with it. Most of the tools have
standalone command line interfaces and pretty good APIs as it is. Although
Detroit can bring smart defaults and nice API uniformity to these, I am
not sure that is enough to constitute a whole separate project without
the assembly line executation chain to make it truely worth while.
Maybe I will split if off at a later date, but if I do the name will 
remain relavent to the name "Detroit".
