    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p class="intro">Reap is an advanced life-cycle based build system and project
    mangement tool. Reap organizes the various tools Ruby developers need to manage their projects,
    from code generation to releasing and promotion.</p>

    <p>Reap is the original project management application for Ruby developers.
    It was first developed in 2005 as a simple add-on to Rake. Since then it has
    gone through a number of transformations in an exploration for the best possible system.
    The final product, Reap 10, is culmination of this work.</p>

    <p>NOTE: The current release is actually the 9.x series. This is a beta series before
    the final release of Reap 10.</p>

    <p>This poor little video is my first crack at a screencast :) It's me creating a new
    project for my <a href="http://cuts.rubyforge.org">Cut-based AOP</a> library. It's a bit scant, but it will at least
    give you a quick idea of what Reap does and how it works.

    <h2>Finally, Reap 10</h2>

    <p>Whew! It's been a long journey... Reap 10 is the culmination of a long exploration
    into the design of a Ruby project management tool, which I conducted on-and-off over
    the last couple of years. Reap started out as an add-on to Rake (similar to Hoe).
    But had soon transformed into a Rake-like build tool in it's own right. However, I
    wasn't satisfied with the design. So Reap remained semi-incomplete as I explored various
    redesigns. It truned out to be a tedious endeavor, and at times I came quite close to
    just putting the whole thing aside. But my own project management requirements kept
    drawing me back. A good thing too. All the work has finally paid off. Reap is proving to
    be an awesome tool.</p>

    <h1>Installation</h1>

    <p>Via RubyGems:</p>

    <pre>
      $ gem install reap
    </pre>

    <p>With the source code:</p>

    <pre>
      $ tar -xzf reap-x.y.z.tar.gz
      $ cd reap-x.y.z
      $ sudo setup.rb
    </pre>

    <p>Microsoft Windows users, you'll have to use <code>ruby setup</code> instead.</p>


    <h1>Usage</h1>

    <p>Reap is a life-cycle based build system. This means there is a linear set of actions
    that are taken with each execution of +reap+. These cycles are called *pipelines* --since
    they pass the project from one action to the next in order. Reap can support any
    variety of pipelines, but three pipelines are provided out of the box. The most central
    of which is the 'main' pipeline.</p>

    <p>Each pipeline consits of a set (or sets) of ordered phases. For instance,
    the main pipeline consists of the following ordered phases:</p>

    <pre>
      configure
      generate
      analyize
      compile
      validate
      document
      package
      release
      promote
      archive
    </pre>

    <!-- reset -->

    <p>To execute reap, one provides the pipeline name and the phase desired, separated by a colon (':').</p>

    <pre>
      $ reap main:document
    </pre>

    <p>Since +main+ is Reap's primary pipeline, it is the default and can be omitted. The above can
    therefore be written more conveniently:

    <pre>
      $ reap document
    </pre>

    <p>When the above command is run, Reap will begin with the top phase (configure) and work it's way down
    executing every phase in order until it completes the phase specified on the command line (in this case
    'document').</p>

    <p>Now you might wonder what the various phases actually do. That all depends on what services are available
    and which and how they are configured. Services are contected to pipelines and phases. For example,
    Reap provides a built-in RDoc service. This is contected to the 'main' pipeline's document phase, as
    well as to the 'site' pipeline's document phase. So if an RDoc service is defined in a project's
    reap configuration, the running 'read document' generated RDoc's for the projects, as will any
    phase after 'document'.</p>

    <p>For more detailed usage documentation, please refer to the <a href="tutorial.xml">tutorial</a>
    and <a href="rdoc/index.html">RDocs</a>.</p>
